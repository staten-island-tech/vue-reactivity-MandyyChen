    <p> Hi Mr.Whalen, this is my secret message to you because when I was searching
    for Google fonts during class, I found this really special one. Since I became super
    invested in integrating this one font, I forgot to actually find a legitimate font for
    the rest of the website. Anyways I doubt you saw this and if you did, you probably
    didn't bother to read so tehe hehe thx for being a gr8 teacher!
